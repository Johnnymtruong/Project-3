# Project-3 Overview:
Every country has different risk factors and death rates that affect their economic wellbeing. The purpose of this project is to analyze the different types of recorded death rates, risk factors, and compare them in a broad scope to determine where certain factors range within a comparable number across different economic climates. An extensive and overall broad dataset that shows over 30 factors of death and risk factors, alongside recorded death instances throughout the globe would mean that we can create extensive visualizations and comparisons between regions/countries to determine which factors affect some areas more than others.	We have also pulled data for GDP Per Capita and Population demographics to determine how high the death rates are based on death causes and risks. This project will show in user-friendly, interactive visualizations the story of the data we have gathered today.

Ethical Considerations:

The goal was to maintain the integrity of the datasets provided, while ensuring we had a full database that would accomodate the possible difference between each set. ID's were allocated based on Country Name and Year to create readable, callable object for our software to utilize. All data was sourced from an organization credited for maintaining data inegrity and knowledgeable data points. The datapoints shown in visualizations are to be intact based on their unique identifiers. No numbers have been altered, and any calculations that have been made are part of an analysis process that is exploratoty in nature, utilized for research purposes, and done so without bias or assumption.
